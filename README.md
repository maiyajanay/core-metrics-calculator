# Core Metrics Calculator

This calculator is a web application designed to help digital media buyers visualize how the change in certain metrics impacts performance. This tools helps advertisers make account optimizations and illustrate to clients why they're being made!

It allows users to enter their on-platform metrics that you can influence, and outputs the engagement and performance metrics that result. This was built as a personal project to bridge the gap between my experience in digital advertising and as a developer, and answers the questions media buyers ask daily: why am I getting these performance results and what should I do about it?
